### Must
- ~~Try to get rid of array operation node~~
- Fix always working with doubles issue
- ~~Add something like Struct or Class for grouping~~
  - ~~Maybe just key value container like JS ?~~
- Implement VM
  - Lexer -> Parser -> Compiler -> Bytecode -> VM
- ~~Add test for var scope~~
  
### Nice to have
- Add Interface to support polymorphism
- add assert so I can testing can be easier.
